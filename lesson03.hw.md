# Lesson 03 H.W.
After creating the UI component in the last H.W. (Lesson 02 H.W.), Now we will use Services for the logic of the player and we will use Components for the logic of the UI.

## The capabilities we will build for the player:
- Option to add songs to the playlist
- Option to remove songs from the playlist
- Option to play the playlist
- Option to stop playing the playlist
- Option to play the next song in the list
- Option to play the previous song in the list

## Services
We will have 2 services in order to achieve these capabilities:
- One service named `player.service.ts` that will hold the state of the player and the songs that the user added to the playlist
- One service named `songs.service.ts` that will hold the list of songs that can be added to the user's playlist
